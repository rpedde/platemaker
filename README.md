# platemaker #

A lame local version of builder.swilkb.com, but locally, and with an eye
toward making openscad (and thereby dxf) for home building on cnc.

Trying to make 1/8" mill friendly designs with dogbones and other features
to make it easier to diy plexi and aluminum keyboard plates.

This owes nothing to swill's fine work, other than inspiration.  All
faults are my own.
